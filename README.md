The Chamaa DeFi Platform combines Compose Multiplatform (Android, Desktop), Ktor server, and Aptos Blockchain to digitize and modernize traditional African savings systems, such as chamaas, stokvels, and esusu, into the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

Inspired by traditional community savings practices in Africa, this platform empowers users by providing a secure, decentralized, and transparent system for managing their collective savings and investments. It leverages Aptos blockchain to ensure immutability and verifiability of transactions, bringing the trust and community support inherent in traditional savings groups into the digital age.

The project is deeply personal to me, inspired by my own experience of how my mother, as a single parent, used a chamaa to pay my school fees. Through the collective efforts of her savings group, she was able to gather enough funds for my education, highlighting the importance of community financial support. My goal is to digitize this practice, giving people better access to a secure and transparent way to manage their group savings.

## Key Features
1. Aptos Blockchain Integration: By incorporating Aptos blockchain, the platform ensures all transactions are secure, transparent, and decentralized, offering users complete control over their funds.
2. Cross-Platform: Built using Kotlin Multiplatform, the platform offers a unified experience across Android and Desktop applications, providing tailored user interfaces for each device while maintaining shared business logic.
3. Ktor Backend: The backend server, built with Ktor, manages user data, handles business logic, and facilitates the secure communication between the app and the blockchain. It also shares DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) between the frontend and backend, ensuring consistent data structures across platforms.
4. Room for Offline Storage: The platform allows users to store and manage their savings group data offline on Android. When an internet connection is available, the data can be synced to the backend server.

# Setup Instructions

### For KTOR Server

#### PostgreSQL Setup
1. **Install PostgreSQL**: To save data to the database from the **Ktor Server**, you'll need to have **PostgreSQL** installed on your machine. After installation, create a database and obtain your **username** and **password**.

2. **Configure Database Connection**: Once you have your credentials, update the `Data.kt` file with your **username** and **password**. This file is located at:

3. **Create the Database**: Ensure you have a database named `chamaa` created in your PostgreSQL setup.

#### Remote Access with Ngrok
To access the running backend server remotely on **Android** or **Desktop**, you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Follow the instructions in the [Ngrok Setup Guide](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/?os=macos).

- After setting up Ngrok and obtaining your unique URL, replace the `test_url` under `HttpClientProvider` with your Ngrok URL. You can find the relevant file in the following structure:
